# Gradle plugins super project
# ----------------------------
# This dockerfile can be used to build
# the gradle plugins necessary for building
# the omero-build super project. This is mostly
# used by travis to test that the plugins are
# all functioning.

# The BUILD_IMAGE argument can be overwritten
# but this is generally not needed unless you
# would like to provide an existing user maven
# directory (~/.m2) to speed up the build.
ARG BUILD_IMAGE=gradle:5.1.1-jdk8
